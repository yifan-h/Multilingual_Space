Below is a figure to describe **functions of our adapters in the knowledge adapter set**. 

We provide pretrained knowledge adapter sets for mBERT, XLMR-base and XLMR-large. Users could find them via [AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/explore/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/yyyyifan/mlkiadapter/tree/main).

Each adapter has a unique function, users could select appropriate one for the usage, or select a fusion mechanism to use them in a compositional way.

>* a) **Adapter-EP** can enhance the phrase-level cross-lingual entity alignment in language models, which is suitable for knowledge graph tasks;
>* b) **Adapter-TP** can enhance the phrase-level factual triple knowledge in language models, which is suitable for knowledge graph tasks;
>* c) **Adapter-ES** can enhance the sentence-level cross-lingual entity alignment in language models, which is suitable for language modeling tasks;
>* d) **Adapter-TS** can enhance the sentence-level factual triple knowledge in language models, which is suitable for language modeling tasks;


## Usage of Our Pretrained Knowledge Adapter Set

We pretrained our 4 adapters on Wikidata (Adapter-EP/TP) and Wikipedia (Adapter-ES) across 84 languages, and T-REx (Adapter-TS) for English.

Using our provided adapters are fairly easy, only 2 steps below.

### 1. Requirements:

The AdapterHub should be installed before usage:

    $ pip install adapter-transformers

### 2. Download and Load Adapters:

Users can download them from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/yyyyifan/mlkiadapter/tree/main) for different pretrained language models.

If you use pretrained language models via HuggingFace, simply add one line after you load the pretrained language model. For example, for the **Adapter-EP**, it can be 

    model.load_adapter(adapter_path, "ep"))

If you want to use the adapter set with a fusion mechanism, for example using `AdapterFusion`, you can:

    import transformers.adapters.composition as ac
    model.load_adapter(adapterep_path, "ep"))
    model.load_adapter(adapteres_path, "es"))
    model.load_adapter(adaptertp_path, "tp"))
    model.load_adapter(adapterts_path, "ts"))
    model.add_adapter_fusion(["ep", "tp", "es", "ts"])
    model.active_adapters = ac.Fuse("ep", "tp", "es", "ts")

After these adapters are loaded, the language model becomes an enhanced one and can be used as usual.
